## Overview  
This project implements a **Python chatbot** that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for query classification and **Deep Learning** for response generation. The chatbot is trained using neural networks and includes **data preprocessing, model training, and an interactive user interface**.  

## Features  
- **Query Classification**: Identifies user intent using NLP techniques.  
- **Deep Learning Model**: Trained using a neural network to improve response accuracy.  
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Allows users to communicate with the chatbot.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and processes input text for better model performance.  

## Project Structure  
- **`train_chatbot.ipynb`** – Used for training the chatbot with a dataset.  
- **`chat_app.ipynb`** – Provides an interface for users to interact with the trained chatbot.  

## Dependencies  
The project requires Python libraries such as **TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, NumPy, and JSON**. Install all dependencies before running the chatbot.  

## Usage  

### 1. Train the Chatbot  
Run the training notebook to prepare the chatbot model.  

### 2. Interact with the Chatbot  
After training, use the chatbot application notebook to start chatting.  

## Results  
The chatbot can understand and classify user queries, providing relevant responses. Training with more data improves its accuracy over time.  

## Acknowledgments  
This project leverages **NLP** and **Deep Learning** techniques to create an AI-powered chatbot using **TensorFlow/Keras**.
